  <h2>Managing your orders & licenses</h2>
  <p>
    Purchases and licenses are managed through <strong>LemonSqueezy</strong>. After
    buying a tool you'll receive an order confirmation email containing your license
    key and download link. You can also access everything from your LemonSqueezy
    customer dashboard at any time:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>View and download all your purchases</li>
    <li>Find your license keys</li>
    <li>Update your billing details or request an invoice</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <a href="https://app.lemonsqueezy.com/my-orders" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
      Manage your orders on LemonSqueezy →
    </a>
  </p>

  <h2>How it works</h2>
  <p>
    When you purchase a Sidequest Plugins tool, you receive a license that allows
    you to use it on your machine. Each license is tied to a single user on a
    single machine.
  </p>

  <h2>How many licenses do I need?</h2>
  <p>Buy one license per user, per machine. Some examples:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You work on a desktop and a laptop — you need <strong>2 licenses</strong>.</li>
    <li>You and a colleague share one machine — you need <strong>2 licenses</strong>.</li>
    <li>A team of 3 people, each with their own machine — you need <strong>3 licenses</strong>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If you're not sure how many you need,{" "}
    <a href="/contact">get in touch</a> and we'll help you figure it out.
  </p>

  <h2>Moving to a new machine</h2>
  <p>
    You can manage your license activations directly from your{" "}
    <a href="https://app.lemonsqueezy.com/my-orders" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
      LemonSqueezy customer dashboard
    </a>. If you need to move to a new machine, deactivate your old machine there first,
    then activate on the new one.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you run into any trouble, email us at{" "}
    <a href={`mailto:${SITE.supportEmail}`}>{SITE.supportEmail}</a> and we'll sort it out.
  </p>

  <h2>Updates</h2>
  <p>
    Your license includes all minor updates within the same major version. For
    example, buying v1.0 gives you free updates through v1.x. A new major version
    (v2.0) would be a separate purchase, but you can continue using the version
    you bought for as long as you like.
  </p>

  <h2>Terms</h2>
  <p>
    By purchasing a license you agree to our{" "}
    <a href="/terms">Terms of Service</a>. Please read it to understand what you
    can and cannot do with your tools.
