  <h2>Our policy</h2>
  <p>
    We offer a <strong>30-day refund</strong> on all purchases, no questions asked.
    If a tool isn't working for you, just reach out within 30 days of your purchase
    date and we'll process a full refund.
  </p>

  <h2>How to request a refund</h2>
  <p>Email us at <a href={`mailto:${SITE.supportEmail}`}>{SITE.supportEmail}</a> with:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your order number or the email address used at checkout</li>
    <li>The name of the product you'd like refunded</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    You can also use the <a href="/contact">contact form</a>. We typically respond
    within one business day.
  </p>

  <h2>After a refund</h2>
  <p>
    Once a refund is processed, your license will be deactivated and you won't be
    able to continue using the tool. Refunds are issued to your original payment
    method.
