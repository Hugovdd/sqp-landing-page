faqs:
  - question: "What versions of After Effects are supported?"
    answer: "AE Sheets supports Adobe After Effects version 24.0 and newer. We recommend using the latest version of After Effects for the best experience."
  - question: "How is AE Sheets different from Find and Replace Fonts?"
    answer: "While Find and Replace Fonts focuses specifically on font replacement, AE Sheets is a comprehensive localization solution. It allows you to export and import text data to spreadsheets, automatically duplicate compositions for different language versions, and includes advanced features like font mapping and layer pinning for complete localization workflows."
  - question: "Which spreadsheet formats can I use with AE Sheets?"
    answer: "AE Sheets supports Excel (.xlsx), CSV files, and can integrate with Google Sheets through CSV import/export. Data can be copied directly from your spreadsheet application and pasted into AE Sheets, or exported and imported using files."
  - question: "How does layer pinning work?"
    answer: "Layer pinning allows you to maintain the position of specified layers relative to text layers, even when the text length changes during localization. This is particularly useful for elements like background boxes or icons that need to maintain a consistent relationship with text elements across different language versions."
  - question: "Can I use AE Sheets on multiple computers?"
    answer: "Yes, your license allows installation on up to two computers (e.g., your work and home machines) as long as they're not used simultaneously."
  - question: "Does AE Sheets work with dynamic text or expressions?"
    answer: "Yes, AE Sheets can handle text layers with expressions. When duplicating compositions, it preserves and updates expressions correctly, ensuring they continue to function properly in the new language versions."
  - question: "How do I install AE Sheets?"
    answer: "AE Sheets is provided as a ZXP file. You can install it using Adobe's Creative Cloud desktop app or third-party extension managers like Anastasiy's Extension Manager."
  - question: "Is there a free trial?"
    answer: "Yes. Download AE Sheets and every feature is yours to explore — no account, no time limit. The one restriction: you can generate up to 10 compositions before being prompted to purchase. That's enough to fully evaluate the tool on a real project."
  - question: "Which AI providers does AE Sheets support?"
    answer: "AE Sheets supports Google Gemini and OpenAI for automatic translation. You bring your own API key from either provider — there's no extra charge from us for AI features, and you're not locked in to one service."
  - question: "Does AE Sheets modify my original After Effects project?"
    answer: "No. AE Sheets always duplicates your master composition before making any changes. Your original project is never touched."
  - question: "Does AE Sheets run natively on Apple Silicon?"
    answer: "Yes. AE Sheets runs natively on M1, M2, M3, and M4 Macs — no Rosetta required."
  - question: "Do I need an internet connection to use AE Sheets?"
    answer: "Only for AI translation and license activation. Rigging, presets, font mapping, and spreadsheet workflows all work entirely offline."
  - question: "Do you offer refunds?"
    answer: "We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee. If AE Sheets doesn't meet your needs, contact us within 30 days of purchase for a full refund."
